The Google Fiber customer service teamâ€™s goal is to determine how often customers are calling customer support after their first inquiry; this will help leadership understand how effectively the team is able to answer customer questions the first time. The dashboard I create should demonstrate an understanding of this goal and provide stakeholders with insights about repeat caller volumes in different markets and the types of problems they represent. 

Dashboard is to:

Help them understand how often customers are calling customer support after their first inquiry; this will help leadership understand how effectively the team is able to answer customer questions the first time

Provide insights into the types of customer issues that seem to generate more repeat calls

Explore repeat caller trends in the three different market cities

Design charts so that stakeholders can view trends by week, month, quarter, and year.
